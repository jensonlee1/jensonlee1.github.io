<p>We like that the Argus 2 features a color night vision alternative, however the white and black variation can really be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage. This isn't really a big deal considering the Argus 2's rate and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick to white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo clever service. However the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
