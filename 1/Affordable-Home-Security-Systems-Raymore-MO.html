<p>On the surface, these 2 camera categories might appear comparable, though if you were able to see within, the distinctions become distinct and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Typically, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is a lot of offered light, and once the lighting ends up being missing or low (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Since they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adapt and capture outstanding low light video, commercial cameras exceed their less expensive cousins.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
