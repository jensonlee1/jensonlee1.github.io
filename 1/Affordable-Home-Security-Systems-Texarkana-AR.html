<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
