<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
