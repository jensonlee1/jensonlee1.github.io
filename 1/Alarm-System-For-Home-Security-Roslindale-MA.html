<p>The genuine reason cameras are usually deployed is to lower much pettier criminal activities. However it has actually not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public places, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have not lowered criminal activity. "Once the criminal activity and offense figures were gotten used to appraise the basic down trend in crimes and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in specific classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually reduced criminal activity in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
