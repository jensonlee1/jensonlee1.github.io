<p>Home security systems and modern-day wise home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to use their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. We thought about just cameras that operate over Wi-Fi without the requirement for a networked video recorder; we narrowed that list down based upon reviews, functions, and cost.
