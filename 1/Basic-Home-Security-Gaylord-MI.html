<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the duty of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to keep and how long you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
<p>Frame rate: This is another crucial element of a camera-- the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is just a series of still images sewn together to create a movie. The lower the frame rate, the less often a still is taken; this leads to choppier video footage. You'll want to consider the frame rate of the camera you purchase before deciding. For reference, "real time" is typically determined as 30 frames per second.
