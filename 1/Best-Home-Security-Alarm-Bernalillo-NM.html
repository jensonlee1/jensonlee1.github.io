<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system.

According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day.
