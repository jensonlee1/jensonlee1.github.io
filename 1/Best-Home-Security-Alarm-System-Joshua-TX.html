<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to aim to make a camera with the most tough setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi info. (You should play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs wail, felines shriek, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>

<p>SimpliSafe's equipment comes with a three-year guarantee and is 100% wireless.

<p>Analogue signals can also be transformed into a digital signal to enable the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings In that case the analogue video camera must be plugged directly into a video capture card in the computer system, and the card then converts the analogue signal to digital.
