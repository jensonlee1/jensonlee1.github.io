The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to solve information after the fact, which implies that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of recording storage space. A lot, in fact, that they need about four times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage.
