Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi info. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work).
