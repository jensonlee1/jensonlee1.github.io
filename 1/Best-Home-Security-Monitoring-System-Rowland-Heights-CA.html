<h3>Alarm System Security Rowland Heights CA 91748</h3>
<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and an incredible value. It receives an Exceptional rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for extra cloud storage. But the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

What you're paying for is mostly that big name in blue.</p>
