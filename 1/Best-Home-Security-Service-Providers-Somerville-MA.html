<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
