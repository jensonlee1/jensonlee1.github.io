<p>Ring may not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has gained quite the fanfare over the years. We have actually been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you pick the complimentary self-monitor" choice.</p>
<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, since it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>

Are you the Do It Yourself type or do you choose to work with an expert? Some home security companies offer both DIY and professional installation, while others only provide one alternative. Make sure to take a look at the installation choices readily available on each system you consider.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
