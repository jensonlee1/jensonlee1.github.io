However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security guard. Several cities also need a permit to even operate a home and own security system.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
