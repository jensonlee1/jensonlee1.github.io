Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You need to play this at complete volume or it won't work).

Anything added extra you would own however if you do not restore their high priced strategy they'll eliminate their" equipment leaving you with no working alarm system. Simply another tricky method to maintain highly rewarding accounts.</p>
