<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
