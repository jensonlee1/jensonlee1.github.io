Wide-angle lenses reduce the number of cameras needed to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might show a 360-degree view, but the very best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or much better.

<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
