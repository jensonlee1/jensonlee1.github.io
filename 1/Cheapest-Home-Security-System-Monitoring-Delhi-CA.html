<p>While every homeowner frets about burglaries, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complicated agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically resulting in false alarms. ELERTS is a free smartphone app that permits people who see something suspicious to take a picture and rapidly send it to public safety officials. For example, a public transit rider might notice somebody acting suspiciously. Many people are messing, texting or surfing with their mobile phones. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap a picture of the suspicious activity and send it to security authorities with a couple of clicks. Reports from smart phone users can be quickly evaluated and acted upon by Public Safety officials.</p>
<p>There's no dedicated center involved here - each camera links straight to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.

While improvements in recent years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own special wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>Each strategy offers distinct advantages. The Secure plan is the most cost-effective package and is perfect for landline homes since it's hardwired into existing telephone connections.Whereas the Smart strategy lets you remotely arm and disarm your system, which works if you choose to access your system utilizing mobile applications. The Total plan, meanwhile, is beneficial if you wish to live stream security data and shop video.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
