<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, scams, and vandalism. Idea: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating pricey false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically switch off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to scare away possible intruders.</p>
