<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>The real reason cameras are generally deployed is to minimize much pettier criminal activities. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that.
