<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize crime. HD CCTV systems are compatible with standard analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable (take a look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have standard analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure.
