<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet.

Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be set up at various residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too. Wireless security plans also allow remote control of the system and basic home automation.
