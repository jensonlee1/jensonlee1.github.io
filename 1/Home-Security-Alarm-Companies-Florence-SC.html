<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cable televisions. DVR systems are challenging to scale up due to the fact that as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to buy a totally new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the linked cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>
