We must again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating expensive incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately switch off the heating systems. If the motion sensors are set off, you can instantly make the clever lights turn on to scare away possible burglars.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
