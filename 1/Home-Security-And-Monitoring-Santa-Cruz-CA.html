<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. With years of experience installing and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle organisations and homes, we've developed great relationships with both local police and their clients.

That being said, bullet cameras are more susceptible to vandalism due to the fact that of their obvious appearance. In addition, the shape of the camera is perfect for concentrating on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but requires numerous cameras if a user requires to see several set views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work inside your home or outdoors. They include a small lip on the end of the camera that adds weather condition protection and lowers glare.</p>
