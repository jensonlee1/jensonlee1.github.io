<h3>Remote Security Camera in Pineville LA</h3>

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
