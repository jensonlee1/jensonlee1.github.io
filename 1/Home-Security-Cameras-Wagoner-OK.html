<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize people you've identified (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

However what about outside the building, or if the burglar has handled to find their method? This is where motion sensing units enter into play.</p>
<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
<p>Today's home security systems let you arm and deactivate your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control board. Thanks to mobile apps, you can see live video with security cameras, inspect notifications, and even produce custom-made actions for your security system and smart home devices.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
