For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; nevertheless, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage normally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage choice conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself.
