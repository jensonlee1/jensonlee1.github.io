<h3>Home Security Camera Reviews in Connecticut</h3>
<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

We also discovered it simple to establish, scalable to small and big homes, and configurable with a range of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensing units to leakage and temperature sensing units. SimpliSafe also deals with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to equip and check the system utilizing only voice commands. It does not deal with lots of third-party smart-home devices, though, and it isn't very helpful without a monitoring membership.</p>
