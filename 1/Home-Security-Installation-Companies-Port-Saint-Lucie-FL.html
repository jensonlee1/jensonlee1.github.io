The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall.
