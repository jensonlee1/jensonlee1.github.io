<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.
