<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
