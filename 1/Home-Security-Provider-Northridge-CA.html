<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Tenants, unlike property owners, generally prevent making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other elements can easily be set up at various properties later, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new elements too. Wireless security strategies also allow remote control of the system and general home automation.
