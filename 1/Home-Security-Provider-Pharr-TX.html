What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in ideal conditions like bright sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in certain scenarios such as nanny webcams or signing in on an animal, though when wanting to collect evidence of a criminal activity they frequently lose.</p>

<p>We love that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision alternative, but the black and white version can actually be clearer and provide you higher-quality video. This isn't truly a huge deal thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with white and black.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>IP (Web protocol) cameras perform the exact same functions as their analog equivalents, but with significantly greater capabilities. IP cameras boast sharper, greater resolution images and more flexible features like remote zoom and repositioning. They also provide you the alternative to view video on a web browser.
