<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most tough setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi details. (You should play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pet dogs howl, cats squeal, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>

Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and pricey method to break-in reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
