<h3>Best Rated Home Security Systems in Connecticut</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider area and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
