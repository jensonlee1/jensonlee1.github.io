If you're trying to find night vision cameras that supply the brightest and best night view, opt for designs that leverage infrared (IR) technology.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
