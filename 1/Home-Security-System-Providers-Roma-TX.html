<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make customers stick with them longer, since changing monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software and firmware.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
