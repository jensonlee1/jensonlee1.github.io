<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the precise very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present.

However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
