<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to keep and how long you prepare to keep recorded video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage area quickly.
