However, you will have to pay for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this doesn't included expert monitoring. This additional cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices each month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal.</p>

The tuning of the system is typically achieved during commissioning of the detection devices.</p>
