<p>The loudest of the clever alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at warning anybody in your house and those close-by that there's a problem. Throughout testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we like that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to account for animals, too. The alarm system is simply one of 2 we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it likewise features a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further discouraging anyone from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property.
