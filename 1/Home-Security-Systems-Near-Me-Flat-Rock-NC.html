<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the deck by a licensed electrician (who occurs to be my hubby).

With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
