In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power.</p>
