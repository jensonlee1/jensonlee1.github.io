<p>This absolutely depends on your house. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensors and equipment than someone who resides in a studio apartment. ADT's higher-tier plans do cost more than many other alarm companies-- plus they need a $99 installation charge-- however if you need a lot of control over the comings and goings of your business, it's most likely worth it.
