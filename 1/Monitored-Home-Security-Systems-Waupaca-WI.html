<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage normally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself. This choice is typically cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video clips in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is normally a paid service and the number of hours it will keep will depend on just how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>

We also sent security companies detailed questionnaires about their services and products.
