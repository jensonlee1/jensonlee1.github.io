The opportunity that the fixed camera would be pointed in the direction of the occurrence depends upon the initial requirements for location of coverage. If there are three select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single set camera can just watch one. This develops a one in three opportunity of capturing a particular event on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center likewise consisted of a computer designated for submitting incident reports online. These can be accessed by management workers at a later date from a database through the computer system network.</p>
