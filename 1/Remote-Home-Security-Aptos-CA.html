<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the specific very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system.
