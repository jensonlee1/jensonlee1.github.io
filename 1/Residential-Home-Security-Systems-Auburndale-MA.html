<p>The genuine reason cameras are normally deployed is to minimize much pettier criminal offenses. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have not lowered criminal offense. "As soon as the criminal activity and offense figures were adapted to take account of the general downward trend in criminal activities and offences," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular categories however there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had minimized criminal activity in general in the city centre."

<h3>House Security System Auburndale MA 02466</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a light inside or activate an external siren when the camera identifies motion.</p>
