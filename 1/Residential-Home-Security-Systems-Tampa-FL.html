<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

Lots of systems use smart device apps as a control, which could provide both the person with a caregiver and an impairment access to the system.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve.
