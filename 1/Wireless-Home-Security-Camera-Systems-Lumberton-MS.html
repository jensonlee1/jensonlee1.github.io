<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we discovered it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly setting off when motion was spotted. We love that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector.
