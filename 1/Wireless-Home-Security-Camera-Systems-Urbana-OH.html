Hard drive storage is safe, secure, and hassle-free, with numerous systems offering expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll require to manually eliminate to transfer the information?
