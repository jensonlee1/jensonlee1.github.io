<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and view it later.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
