<p>Bullet cameras are among the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and a distinctive appearance.

Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work inside your home or outdoors. They include a small lip on completion of the camera that includes weather protection and reduces glare.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network.

Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
