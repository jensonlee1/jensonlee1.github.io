<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
<h3>Best Home Security Alarm System in New York</h3>
<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
