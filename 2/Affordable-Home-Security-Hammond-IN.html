I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for example. However, those functions come at a relatively steep price: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.
