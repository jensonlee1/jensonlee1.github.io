<p>Home security systems and modern-day smart home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to take advantage of their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a design that offers a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and budget-friendly cloud storage for taped video.
