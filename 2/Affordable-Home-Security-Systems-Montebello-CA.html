<p>What many people do not understand is that there is another class of security camera that is straight available to the public, though not discovered in the huge box and warehouse stores.

<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand out too much. Pretty simple to install.

The second essential thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly shrill in-built alarm, so it works as a home alarm along with a security camera.

<p>That possible flaw aside, the Arlo Q provided sharp and vibrant 130-degree video and still images, in both intense and dim light, even when utilizing the 8 x digital zoom. The night mode produced remarkably crisp images, but they didn't look as bright as the Logitech Circle 2's. However, using the SimpliSafe mobile app needs a paid monitoring strategy.
