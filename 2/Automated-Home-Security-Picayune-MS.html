As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals may find out to be careful about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers.
