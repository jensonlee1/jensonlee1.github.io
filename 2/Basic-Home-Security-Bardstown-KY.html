More recently, decentralized IP cameras, maybe equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage gadgets, or internal flash for entirely stand-alone operation.</p>
<p>It's a first-class bundle but it's pricey, and to get the most out of it (like cloud storage archives or motion zones) you really require to register for a membership too. If you're on a budget, you can just about get by with the live motion notifies and livestreaming (no subscription needed). The Nest IQ is a seriously outstanding piece of innovation.
