<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a must for use when you're away from home, but you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it simple to arm and disarm the system. If you already own a Ring video doorbell and want to expand your home security protection, including Ring Alarm makes sense.
