<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
