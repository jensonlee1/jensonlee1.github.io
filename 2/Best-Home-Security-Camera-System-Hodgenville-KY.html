<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
