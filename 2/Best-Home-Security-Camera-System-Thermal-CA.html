<p>Most modern CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which allow operators to reap some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog footage to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it much easier to browse archived footage, and likewise allows users to stream video over a network for remote viewing from numerous areas. Typically, the mere presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated intruders. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or harmed by the more identified robbers. If trespassers can not see any security cameras, they might also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
