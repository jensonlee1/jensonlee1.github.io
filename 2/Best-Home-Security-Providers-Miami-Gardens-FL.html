<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT also has more industry experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe. This especially matters throughout emergencies-- if a natural disaster removes one ADT monitoring center, the others are still up and running to protect your home.

<p>Another method to save recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
