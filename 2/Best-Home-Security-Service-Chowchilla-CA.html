<p>We looked for DIY systems that provided professional monitoring, both with and without a contract.

Some individuals may want to sign up for service just for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you utilize, in addition to how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>
