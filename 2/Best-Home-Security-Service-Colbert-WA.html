<p>As you just learned, there are 2 broad classifications of security cameras. What you normally discover at shops are consumer-grade cameras, which typically come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (United States $) for the set.

Guidelines such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Numerous municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
