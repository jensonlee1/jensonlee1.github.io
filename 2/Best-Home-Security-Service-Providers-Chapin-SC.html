<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
