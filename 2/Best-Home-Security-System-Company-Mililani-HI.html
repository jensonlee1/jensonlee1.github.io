<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based upon available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.

However, this method isn't foolproof: intruders have ended up being smart to the practice of publishing phony signs and cameras, and ever-bolder lawbreakers may be happy to take a threat. Therefore, each property owner has to consider their own risk tolerance, but it's normally worth buying an actual home security system that offers strong comfort.</p>
