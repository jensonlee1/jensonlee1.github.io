<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on produced to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked.

The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
