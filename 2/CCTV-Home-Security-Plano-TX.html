<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We should again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating pricey incorrect alarms.

There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
