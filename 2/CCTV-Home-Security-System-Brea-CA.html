Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they happen frequently enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.

Otherwise, exact same principle, very same app, still just as simple. to setup. And you do not need to fret about its battery life. Normally, the battery could last for 4 to 6 months per charge.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
