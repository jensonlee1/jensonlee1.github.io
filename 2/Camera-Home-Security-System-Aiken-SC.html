The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>

Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
