<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an incredible value. It receives an Excellent rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage. However the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is found.
