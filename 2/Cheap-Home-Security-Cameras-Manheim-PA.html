<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, mobility and impermanence. Occupants, unlike house owners, generally avoid making permanent modifications to their homes.

In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can quickly be set up at various properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new elements too. Wireless security strategies also allow remote control of the system and general home automation.
