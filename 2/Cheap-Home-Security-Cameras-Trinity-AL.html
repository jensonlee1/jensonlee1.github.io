<p>On the surface, these 2 camera categories may appear similar, though if you were able to see within, the differences end up being distinct and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and developed for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not.

<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an incredible worth. It receives an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
