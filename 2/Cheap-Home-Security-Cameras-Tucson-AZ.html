The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
