<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the fact, which suggests that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and use up a great deal of taping storage space. A lot, in fact, that they need about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
