Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You need to play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pets growl, felines shriek, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
