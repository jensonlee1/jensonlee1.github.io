<p>The genuine reason cameras are typically released is to reduce much pettier criminal offenses. But it has actually not even been demonstrated that they can do that.

"As soon as the criminal offense and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the basic downward trend in offenses and criminal offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were noted in particular classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually reduced criminal activity overall in the city centre."
