<h3>Security System Cameras in Purcellville VA</h3>

Z-Wave and Zigbee are a few of the more common wireless innovations utilized by significant security companies.

The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and watch it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
