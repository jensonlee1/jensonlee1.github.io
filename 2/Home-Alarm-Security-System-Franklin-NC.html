<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize criminal activity. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was faulty, therefore we might review this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video footage to the cloud.
