<p>The $20 Wyze Camera isn't simply an excellent budget plan security camera, it's a great camera. Period.

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range concerns.</p>

Flood lights can hinder vandals or scare them away, but as a single tool, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
