<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
