<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute considerably to cops capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and costly approach to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
