<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server run by the manufacturer, rather of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a linked disk drive.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
