<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
