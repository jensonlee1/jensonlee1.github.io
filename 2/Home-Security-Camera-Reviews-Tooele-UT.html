<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a regular camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to solve detail after the fact, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of tape-recording storage area.
