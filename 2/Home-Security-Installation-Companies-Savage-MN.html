<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
