Some of Google Nest's cameras do provide facial acknowledgment, but they can't trip alarms (based on whether they acknowledge someone or otherwise). Some alarm companies deliberately program communication delays into their home alarm system. These delays, which can be as long as 4 minutes, are set up to cut down on incorrect alarms. Our systems are configured so that we receive your alarm signal instantly.</p>
