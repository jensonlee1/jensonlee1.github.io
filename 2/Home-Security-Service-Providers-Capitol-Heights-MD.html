<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough.

The exact same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
