<p>Thanks to recent improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install an alarm system, you must consider the following benefits of wireless innovation. The $260 Fundamentals package includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensors, one motion sensor, a backyard indication, and 2 window decals. For $15 per month, you can include ongoing professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control by means of iOS and Android smart device apps, push and email signals, and 30-day event-footage storage for limitless cameras, consisting of the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is offered separately.
