<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a declaration stating the system would signal users when it detected any type of interference. The company likewise questioned the video, declaring that there would require to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the issue.
