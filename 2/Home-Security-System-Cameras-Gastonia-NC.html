<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home gadgets like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for potential package thieves or speak with visitors who come by.</p>
<p>The app isn't quite as refined as we may like, and the Alexa and Google Assistant integration isn't much to write home about, but in general this is a home security camera that isn't going to let you down.
