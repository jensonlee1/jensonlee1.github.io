<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We need to again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating costly incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately shut off the heater. You can instantly make the smart lights turn on to frighten away potential intruders if the motion sensors are activated.</p>
