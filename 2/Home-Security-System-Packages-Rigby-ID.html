<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the specific very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
