<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to send the WiFi details. (You need to play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets howl, felines scream, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds.
