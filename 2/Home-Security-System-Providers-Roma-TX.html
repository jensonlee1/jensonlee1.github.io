<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly innovative, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a big commitment.

We also experienced above-average connection issues, with 2 Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is extremely simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices.

House owners can call customer care in between 5am and 10pm to get guidance on the equipment required for their home, and there is a Neighbors app that imitates a virtual neighborhood watch.

ADT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 watchful people with smart devices is much better security than one security individual seeing 10,000 people on CCTV.</p>

You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, especially for cameras. And to be sincere, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first location. What you're spending for is mostly that huge name in blue.</p>
