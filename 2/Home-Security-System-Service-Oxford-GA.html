<p>The loudest of the smart alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at alerting anyone in your house and those close-by that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adapted to represent family pets, too. The alarm system is simply one of 2 we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more preventing anybody from trying to break in to your property. We tested Somfy's more expensive system, which featured a wifi security camera, however more economical packages are also offered. In spite of the large price here, there's no external monitoring choice.</p>
