<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
