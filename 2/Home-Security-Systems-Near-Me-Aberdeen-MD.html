<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger location and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Unlike wired security systems, wireless systems allow for on-the-go" monitoring of your system from a cell phone - anytime, anywhere. Nearly every security camera we looked at supports encryption.
