Still, you get a decent quantity of features, and without a membership too, so it's quickly among the best security cameras of 2020. Something else to keep an eye out for: All-in-one DIY security devices developed for smaller sized homes and living spaces.

<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom.
