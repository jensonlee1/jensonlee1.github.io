<p>Motion sensors provide backup protection in case a burglar handles to get into your home. But they only operate when you're out of the house. Do not believe they'll secure you if somebody goes into when you're sleeping! Quite the opposite, your alarm really neglects motion sensor signals if you arm the system but stay at home. If the system worked any other method, it would false alarm every time you strolled into a protected room.</p>
