<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video.

The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.
