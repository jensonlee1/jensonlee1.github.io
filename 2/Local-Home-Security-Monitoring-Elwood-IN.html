<p>Microphonic systems vary in style (for example, time-domain reflectrometry or piezo-electric) but each is generally based upon the detection of an intruder trying to climb up or cut over a fence. Generally the microphonic detection systems are set up as sensing unit cables connected to rigid chainwire fences, however some specialised versions of these systems can also be set up as buried systems underground. Depending upon the variation picked, it can be sensitive to various frequencies or levels of noise or vibration. The system is based upon coaxial or electro-magnetic sensing unit cable television with the controller having the ability to distinguish in between signals from the cable or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing up the fence, or bad climate condition.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
