<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

It's motion activated, sending you an alert when someone sounds the doorbell or goes into the location. Plus, it provides you two-way interaction with the canine walker on your deck. You can confirm who they are and then open the door and deactivate the alarm system right from the Vivint app.</p>
