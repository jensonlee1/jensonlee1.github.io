<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
