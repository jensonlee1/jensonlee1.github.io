<p>Keypad: A smartphone app is a should for usage when you're away from home, however you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and deactivate the system. Including Ring Alarm makes sense if you already own a Ring video doorbell and want to broaden your home security coverage.
