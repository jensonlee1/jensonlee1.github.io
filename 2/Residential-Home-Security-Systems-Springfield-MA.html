<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line camping tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heater at 5am. The very first guard showed up early so he might look at the whole area and speak to me about my issues. He was expert, polite and very reassuring. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the morning to get the occasion started, he was also expert, polite and reassuring. We were extremely delighted with your service and I will advise that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. As soon as after leaving our home in your hands, I didn't worry.</p>
