<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof since it doesn't have wires that can be cut. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Kid was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is really fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
