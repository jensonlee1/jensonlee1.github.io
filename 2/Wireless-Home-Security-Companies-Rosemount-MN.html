<p>Though most of our attention these days is concentrated on the transition to IP video innovation, it is very important to keep in mind that analog CCTV security cameras can still be extremely efficient for lots of surveillance applications, especially those on a spending plan. With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local seeing from one central monitoring area.

<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not require a new keypad. Using multiple sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector journeys in one area, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor notifies the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch immediately.
