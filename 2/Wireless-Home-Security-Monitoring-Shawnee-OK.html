<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 services, universities, and government centers, and residential clients. After researching 4 various security systems, we decided on SSA. They provided us the best description of their services and provided us more for the cash. After having a bad experience with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a really professional installation needs to be. We feel very safe understanding our home is secured by SSA.

While improvements over the last few years have made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own unique wireless innovation, which can't be interfered with by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>

Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
