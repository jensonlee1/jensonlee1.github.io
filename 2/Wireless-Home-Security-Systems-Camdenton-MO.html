<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, starting with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its double articulating LED floodlights cover an extremely large location, and you can dim them via its app if you desire mood lighting on your deck or patio for a party. In addition they can not transmit fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
