Box cameras provide an obvious sign for anyone who passes by that they are being tape-recorded on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime. Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a bigger area such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>
<p>Home security companies use a wide variety of equipment alternatives, from mounted control panel setups to totally automated systems controlled by tablets or smart devices.

Furthermore they can not send fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video.

If you do buy them, first examine the suppliers return policy and second keep the invoice.</p>
