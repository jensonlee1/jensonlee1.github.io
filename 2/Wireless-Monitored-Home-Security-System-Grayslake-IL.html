As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
